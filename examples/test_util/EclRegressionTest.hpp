/*! \brief A class for executing a regression test for two ECLIPSE files.
    \details This class inherits from ECLFilesComparator, which opens and
             closes the input cases and stores keywordnames.
             The three public functions gridCompare(), results() and
             resultsForKeyword() can be invoked to compare griddata
             or keyworddata for all keywords or a given keyword (resultsForKeyword()).

If no exceptions are thrown, resultsForKeyword() uses the private member funtion printResultsForKeyword to print the average and median deviations.
